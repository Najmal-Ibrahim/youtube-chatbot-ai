# 🤖 YouTube-to-Chatbot AI

An AI-powered chatbot that lets you "talk to" any YouTube video. Instead of watching the full video, ask specific questions and get instant answers based on the video's transcript.

*(Optional: Create a short GIF of your chatbot in action and link it here. Highly recommended!)*

## ✨ Core Features

-   **Instant Answers:** Ask questions about a video's content and get immediate, relevant responses.
-   **Efficient Learning:** Quickly extract key information from long lectures, tutorials, or podcasts.
-   **Content Summarization:** Get a high-level summary of a video without watching it.
-   **Powered by RAG:** Uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern to provide accurate, context-aware answers and minimize hallucinations.

## 🛠️ How It Works (Architecture)

The project follows a standard RAG pipeline:

1.  **Data Ingestion & Indexing:**
    *   The audio is extracted from the YouTube video.
    *   The audio is transcribed into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
    *   The text is split into smaller, meaningful chunks.
    *   Each chunk is converted into a numerical embedding and stored in a FAISS vector database.

2.  **Querying & Generation:**
    *   The user's question is converted into an embedding.
    *   A similarity search is performed on the vector store to find the most relevant text chunks.
    *   These chunks (context) and the user's question are passed to an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5).
    *   The LLM generates a final answer based on the provided context.

## ⚙️ Setup and Usage

This project is designed to run in a Google Colab notebook.

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/youtube-chatbot-ai.git
    ```

2.  **Open in Google Colab:**
    *   Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    *   Go to `File` -> `Upload notebook` and upload the `youtube_chatbot.ipynb` file.
    *   Alternatively, open directly from GitHub by using the URL: `https://colab.research.google.com/github/YourUsername/youtube-chatbot-ai/blob/main/youtube_chatbot.ipynb`

3.  **Add API Keys:**
    *   This project requires an OpenAI API key.
    *   In the Colab notebook, use the "Secrets" manager (key icon on the left panel) to securely store your API key. Add a new secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY` and paste your key as the value. This is much safer than pasting your key directly in a code cell.

4.  **Install Dependencies & Run:**
    *   The first code cell in the notebook will install all required libraries.
    *   Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook is commented to guide you through the process:
        *   **Setup:** Installs libraries and sets up the API key.
        *   **Ingestion:** Provide a YouTube URL to process the video.
        *   **Chat:** Ask your questions in the final cells!

## 🔮 Future Improvements

-   [ ] **Add Timestamps:** Link answers back to the specific timestamp in the YouTube video.
-   [ ] **Build a Streamlit UI:** Create a user-friendly web interface for a better user experience.
-   [ ] **Multi-Video Chat:** Extend the system to chat with an entire playlist or YouTube channel.
-   [ ] **Support for Open-Source LLMs:** Add options to use models like Llama 3 or Mistral.
